	<h1>Stella's Funhouse</h1>
	<p>Little Stella, the small Flat-Coat Retriever, who came to us from St. Hubert's on that fateful October weekend, is adjusting to life in Madison just fine. Though, she has eaten some pillows, chair arms and legs, as well as all the bark from a tree!</p>
	<p>Today is May 1 and it's her birthday! She turned 1. Happy birthday Stella!
